# MagicButton - LED touch control

This is a touch button emulating of Siemens S576B

Initially designed to control the brightness of an LED lamp

Logic of work:

If the light is off - a short press turns on the light, a long press turns the light on to the maximum brightness

If the light is on - a short press turns off the light, long press adjusts the brightness

To change the direction of brightness adjustment, you must repeat a long press
